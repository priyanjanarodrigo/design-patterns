## Strategy Pattern

### What is Strategy Pattern ?
```
When considering about the idea behind the strategy pattern is that, it's about using
composition rather than using inheritance. 

It's about understanding that, inheritance is not intended for code reuse.

The strategy pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one and makes them
interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently, from clients that use it.
