> Design patterns - General notes
---------------------------------

* In 1994, there was a book released called "Design Patterns". There were 4 authors for that and, they were called
  "Gang of Four" (Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson and John Vlissides)

* In that book they divided these entire patterns into 3 main categories. Under each category they put some
  design patterns which can be followed when coding.

* There are three design pattern categories (for diagram please refer "design-pattern-categories.png" file)
    1. Creational Patterns:
        1 - Singleton
        2 - Factory/ Factory Method
        3 - Abstract Factory
        4 - Builder
        5 - Prototype

    2. Structural Patterns:
        6 - Adapter
        7 - Composite
        8 - Proxy
        9 - Fly Weight
        10 - Facade
        11 - Bridge
        12 - Decorator

    3. Behavioural Patterns:
        13 - Template Method
        14 - Mediator
        15 - Chain of Responsibility
        16 - Observer
        17 - Strategy
        18 - Command
        19 - State
        20 - Visitor
        21 - Iterator
        22 - Interpreter
        23 - Momento
        24 - Null Object Pattern (Not there in the diagram)

* There are capable, tested and proven set of patterns that we can adopt in our development in any programming language.
