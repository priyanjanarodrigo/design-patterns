# Design patterns

- In 1994, there was a book released
  called `Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software`. There were 4 authors for
  that and,
  they were called "Gang of Four" (Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson and John Vlissides)


- In that book they divided these entire patterns into 3 main categories. Under each category they
  put some design patterns which can be followed when coding.

```
    * Creational Patterns:
    
       1 - Singleton
       2 - Factory Method/ Factory
       3 - Abstract Factory
       4 - Builder
       5 - Prototype

    * Structural Patterns:
    
       6  - Adapter
       7  - Composite
       8  - Proxy
       9  - Fly Weight
       10 - Facade
       11 - Bridge
       12 - Decorator

    * Behavioural Patterns:
    
       13 - Template Method
       14 - Mediator
       15 - Chain of Responsibility
       16 - Observer
       17 - Strategy
       18 - Command
       19 - State
       20 - Visitor
       21 - Iterator
       22 - Interpreter
       23 - Momento
       24 - Null Object Pattern
```

- There are capable, tested and proven set of patterns that we can adopt in our development in any
  programming language.


- Apart from that book, there is `Head First Design Patterns` book which is really useful for
  beginners.


- This particular multimodule maven project contains these design patterns with theoretical
  references (included in each module's `README.md` file) as well as different example
  implementations.
